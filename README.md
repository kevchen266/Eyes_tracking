# Eye-Tracking Project

This project aims to develop an eye-tracking system that captures, processes, and analyzes eye movement data using OpenCV.

## Current Stage

At this stage, we are using OpenCV to detect eyeball movement. The data obtained is not yet accurate, but we want to document this stage for future reference.

## Branch Information

This version of the project is stored in the `opencv-detection-stage` branch.
